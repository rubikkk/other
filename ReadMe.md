### iammatthias.com 

Site content is now 99% MDX served through Contentful. Hosted on IPFS using fleek.co

#### Built With 
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Fleek](https://www.fleek.co/), host
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), CMS
- [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), primitives 
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), components in markdown
- [Segment](https://segment.com/), analytics & more


Things are set up to allow for themed modular page creation through Contentful using MDX, or through stand-alone custom pages that exist without the standard Layout wrapper. 

This is fun.
